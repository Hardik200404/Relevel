Creating your own branch from master branch
first clone the public repo of Himanshu sir
git clone https://github.com/hparwani2/module-2.git

then "git branch" will give the list of branch and in which we are in
then "git checkout -b Hardik" will create new branch from master named Hardik

so if lets say there have been some changes in master branch
we can check it by typing "git status", will the changes happened 

then we can do is "git add." will add all changes,we can add path to add particular change
then "git commit"
then "git push origin Hardik" will push the changes to my branch 

"git stash" incase of file deletion in my branch
"git fetch" incase of branch deletion
